Oil prices are inherently volatile, influenced by both global and domestic factors. Norway, as a major oil exporter, experiences economic fluctuations tied to this variability. A fundamental way to understand these shifts is through the basic economic principles of **supply and demand**.

## The Supply and Demand Model

The price of oil in a competitive market is determined by the intersection of supply and demand. The general equilibrium condition can be expressed as:

$Q_d(P) = Q_s(P)$

Where:
- $Q_d(P)$ is the quantity of oil demanded at price $P$,
- $Q_s(P)$ is the quantity of oil supplied at price $P$.

A typical demand function follows:

$Q_d = \alpha - \beta P$

Where:
- $\alpha$ represents baseline demand when price is zero,
- $\beta$ is the sensitivity of demand to price.

Conversely, the supply function is often modeled as:

$Q_s = \gamma + \delta P$

Where:
- $\gamma$ represents production independent of price,
- $\delta$ captures how supply increases with price.

Setting $Q_d = Q_s$ and solving for equilibrium price:

$P^* = \frac{\alpha - \gamma}{\beta + \delta}$

## Impact of External Shocks

Several factors can shift these curves, impacting equilibrium price:

1. **OPEC Decisions** – If OPEC cuts production, $Q_s$ decreases, leading to higher equilibrium prices.
2. **Technological Advances** – Improvements in extraction technology can increase $Q_s$, lowering prices.
3. **Government Policies** – Norway's sovereign wealth fund and taxation policies affect both demand and supply indirectly.

## Conclusion

By analyzing the supply and demand framework, we can better understand oil price fluctuations in Norway. While economic models offer insights, real-world influences such as geopolitics, regulations, and market speculation add complexity to predicting future trends.
